# Castle of Magic: The Card Game
A modern reimagining of a classic board game of magic and intrigue.

Castle of Magic: The Card Game is a game for 4-6 players and can be played in 30-60 minutes.
It is intended for players who are at least twelve years old.

## Background
Thirty years ago, a group of adventurers journeyed to Castle Bondi to confront a Monster that lurked within.
By manipulating the occult power of three arcana they were able to perform a ritual spell and imprison the Monster.
The adventurers later established a network of twenty-seven shrines to channel the magical energies required to ensure that the Monster could not escape its prison.

Recently, three rival factions of wizards - the Dragon Masters, the Eagle Lords, and the Wolf Mages - have discovered how to corrupt the shrines.
These factions began to use their power to control the three countries - Kida, Marus, and Sorrell - in which the shrines are located.
As a result, the spell that binds the Monster has begun to falter.

Now, wizards from the three factions have come together to harness the power of the shrines.<!--and try to banish the monster once and for all.-->
If they succeed, their factions will vie for control of the kingdom.
If they fail, they risk releasing the Monster and being devoured as it rampages.

## Overview
You will assume the role of a character who will try to harness the power of the shrines.
You will have a set of secret objectives based on what faction you belong to and what country you are from.

To accomplish your objectives, you will manipulate the twenty-seven shrines.
Whether you accomplish each of your objectives will depend on the state of the shrines at the end of the game.

The game will end when you cast the ritual spell.
The fate of the Monster will depend on which version of the ritual spell you cast.

Your score will depend on how many of your objectives you accomplish.
The players with the highest scores will win the game.

## Set Up
test

## Arcana
Three arcana - the bell, the book, and the candle - were originally used to summon the Monster.
Now, the wizards will harness the power of the arcana to cast the ritual spell.

The nature of the ritual spell will depend on how each of of the arcana are used when it is cast.
Each of the arcana can be used in one of two ways:
  - The bell can be either ringing or silent.
  - The book can be either open or closed.
  - The candle can be either lit or unlit.

So, there are eight different possibilities for what will happen when the ritual spell is cast.

## Regalia
Three pieces of regalia - the amulet, the crown, and the scepter - were originally used to control the Monster.
Each piece of regalia was interred within one of the twenty-seven shrines when the Monster was imprisoned.
Now, the regalia are treasures that the wizards can claim to further their personal ambitions.

When the ritual spell is cast, any character who has claimed a piece of regalia may draw the attention of the Monster.
In some cases, the character who claimed a certain piece of regalia will be able to dominate the Monster.
In other cases, the character who claimed a certain piece of regalia will be devoured by the Monster before it is banished.

## The Twenty-Seven Shrines
The twenty-seven shrines were built to channel the magical energies required to imprison the monster.
Each shrine is attuned to one of the three arcana and is located in one of the three countries.

Each shrine is represented by a shrine card.
These cards will be arranged in a _tableau_ consisting of three rows of nine cards.

Each row of the tableau will contain the cards that represent the shrines that are attuned to one of the arcana.
  - The top row contains cards for the shrines that are attuned to the bell.
  - The middle row contains cards for the shrines that are attuned to the book.
  - The bottom row contains cards for the shrines that are attuned to the candle.

The columns of the tableau contain the cards that represent the shrines that are located in one of the three countries.
  - The leftmost three columns contain cards for the shrines that are located in Kida.
  - The central three columns contain cards for the shrines that are located in Marus.
  - The rightmost three columns contain cards for the shrines that are located in Sorrell.

Most of the shrines have been corrupted by one of the three factions.
Only the shrines in which the regalia are interred have not been corrupted.
The factions can use the shrines that they have corrupted to exert control over the countries in which those shrines are located.
  - Eight shrines have been corrupted by the Dragon Masters.
  - Eight shrines have been corrupted by the Eagle Lords.
  - Eight shrines have been corrupted by the Wolf Mages.

Each shrine can be either active or inactive.
  - If a shrine card is face up, then the corresponding shrine is active.
  - If a shrine card is face down, then the corresponding shrine in inactive.

## The Ritual Spell
The game ends when the wizards cast the ritual spell.
The nature of the ritual spell depends on how each of the arcana are used when it is cast.
How each arcanum is used depends on the state of the shrines that are attuned to that arcanum.
  - If the majority of the shrines in the top row of the tableau are active, then the bell is ringing. Otherwise, the bell is silent.
  - If the majority of the shrines in the middle row of the tableau are active, then the book is open. Otherwise, the bell is closed.
  - If the majority of the shrines in the bottom row of the tableau are active, then the candle is lit. Otherwise, the candle is unlit.

### Outcomes
There are eight possible outcomes when the ritual spell is cast.
  - The Monster is banished outright.
  - The character who claimed the amulet dominates the Monster.
  - The character who claimed the crown dominates the Monster.
  - The character who claimed the scepter dominates the Monster.
  - The character who claimed the amulet is devoured by the Monster. Afterwards, the Monster is banished.
  - The character who claimed the crown is devoured by the Monster. Afterwards, the Monster is banished.
  - The character who claimed the scepter is devoured by the Monster. Afterwards, the Monster is banished.
  - The Monster is released. All characters are devoured as the Monster rampages.

Each outcome corresponds to one of the ways the three arcana can be used in the ritual spell.
The mapping between outcomes and how the arcana are is random and changes from game to game.

Each outcome is represented by an outcome card.
Each way the arcana can be used is represented by a ritual card.
The ritual cards should be arranged face up in a single row near the tableau.
Each outcome card should be placed face down on top of a random ritual card.
Ensure that the outcome cards do not obscure the icons on the underlying ritual cards.

### Casting the Ritual Spell
At the beginning of the game, all of the outcome cards will be face down.
During the game, players will have the opportunity to turn the outcome cards face up.
The ritual spell is cast immediately when the last outcome card is turned face up.

## Characters
There are three kinds of characters: wizards, cultists, and the Monster.

### Wizards
Each wizard is affiliated with both a faction and a country.
Each wizard's affiliations are represented in the form of a coat of arms.

The shield in a wizard's coat of arms indicates the country that they are from.
The supporters (animals either behind or to either side of the shield) in a wizard's coat of arms indicate the faction that they belong to.

Each wizard scores:
  - 1000 points for every country that their faction controls.
  - 1000 points if their faction controls the country that they are from.
  - 1000 points for every piece of regalia that they claim.
  - 1000 points for dominating the Monster.

A wizard who is devoured by the Monster cannot claim any of the regalia.

At most, a wizard can score 7000 points, 1000 points for accomplishing each of seven different objectives.
To do so, their faction must rule all three countries (3000 points) which necessarily ensures that their faction controls the country that they are from (1000 points), they must claim two regalia (2000 points), and they must dominate the Monster as a result of the ritual spell (1000 points).

### Cultists
Each cultist is affiliated with a faction.
Cultists are not affiliated with any country.
Instead, cultists worship the Monster.
Each cultists affiliations are represented in the form of a coat of arms.

The shield in a cultists coat of arms bears the image of the Monster.
The supporters in a cultist's coat of arms indicate the faction that they belong to.

Each cultist scores:
  - 1000 points for each country that their faction controls.
  - 1000 points for each piece of regalia that they claim.
  - 1000 points if the Monster devours any wizards or cultists.

A cultist who is devoured by the monster cannot claim any of the regalia.

At most, a cultist can score 6000 points, 1000 points for accomplishing each of six different objectives.
To do so, their faction must rule all three countries (3000 points), they must claim two regalia, and the monster must devour at least one wizard or cultist (1000 points).

### The Monster
The Monster has the ability to disguise itself as a wizard.
If you are the Monster, then you can manipulate the shrines and the ritual cards as if you were a wizard.
The only practical difference between the Monster and a wizard that they have different objectives.

The Monster scores:
  - 7000 points it devours at least one wizard or cultist.

The Monster can claim regalia but will not score points for doing so.
The Monster cannot devour itself.
