# Castle of Magic: The Card Game
A modern successor to a classic board game of magic and intrigue.

Castle of Magic: The Card Game is a game for 4-6 players and can be played in 30-60 minutes.
It is intended for players who are at least twelve years old.

## Background
Thirty years ago, a group of adventurers journeyed to Castle Bondi to confront a Monster that lurked within.
By manipulating the occult power of three arcana they were able to perform a ritual spell and imprison the Monster.
The adventurers later established a network of twenty-seven shrines to channel the magical energies required to ensure that the Monster could not escape its prison.

Recently, however, three rival factions of wizards have discovered how to corrupt the shrines and use their power to control the countries in which they are located.
As a result, the spell that binds the Monster has begun to falter.

Now, wizards from the three factions have come together to harness the power of the shrines and try to banish the monster once and for all.
If they succeed, their factions will vie for control of the kingdom.
If they fail, they risk releasing the Monster and being devoured as it rampages.

<!-- ## Overview
You will assume the role of a character who has a set of secret objectives.
Some characters have objectives that are mutually compatible.
Those characters are natural allies.
Other characters are natural rivals.
You will want to try to figure out what the other characters' objectives are and adjust your strategy accordingly.

To accomplish your objectives, you will manipulate the cards in a tableau.
Each card can be turned either face up or face down.
On your turn you can flip up to two cards, thereby changing the current state of the tableau.
Whether you accomplish each of your objectives depends on the state of the tableau at the end of the game.

You will use a second set of cards to track your progress.
These cards start face down.
On your turn you can choose to turn one of these cards face up instead of manipulating the tableau.
The game ends when all of these cards have been turned face up.

You will score points for each objective that you accomplish. 
You win if you score the most points.

## Overview
You will assume the role of one of these wizards.
You will have a set of secret objectives based on what faction you belong to and what country you are from.
Other wizards from your faction will be your natural allies.
Other wizards from your country will be your natural rivals.
So, you will want to try to figure out what the other wizards' secret objectives are and adjust your strategy accordingly.

To accomplish your secret objectives, you will manipulate the twenty-seven shrines.
Each shrine will be represented by a shrine card.
These shrine cards will be arranged in a tableau.
Each shrine card can be turned either face up or face down to indicate if the corresponding shrine is active or inactive.
On your turn you can flip one or two of the shrine cards, thereby changing the state of the tableau.
Whether you accomplish each of your secret objectives will depend on the state of the tableau at the end of the game.

The game will end when you cast the ritual spell.
The nature of this spell will be determined by the eight ritual cards.
These cards start face down.
On your turn you can choose to turn one of these cards face up instead of manipulating the shrines.
The ritual spell will be cast when all eight ritual cards have been turned face up.

## Scoring
There are two kinds of characters: basic characters and the Monster.
Each kind of character scores points in different ways.

### Basic Characters
Each basic character belongs to one of the three factions and is from one of the three countries. Each character's affiliations are represented on their character card in the form of a coat of arms.

The shield in a character's coat of arms indicates the country that they are from. The supporters (animals either behind or to either side of the shield) in a character's coat of arms indicate the faction that they belong to.

Each basic character scores one point for each country that their faction controls at the end of the game. They score one additional point if their faction controls the country that they are from.

Each basic character scores one point for each piece of regalia that they control at the end of the game.

If a basic character is devoured by the Monster, they score zero points.

<!-- ### Cultists
Each basic character belongs to one of the three clans. Cultists do not owe fealty to any of the three countries. Instead, cultists worship the Hydra.

Each cultist scores one point for each country that their guild controls at the end of the game.

Each cultist scores one point for each piece of regalia that they control at the end of the game.

Each cultist scores one point if the Monster devours any characters at the end of the game.

If a cultist is devoured by the Monster, they score one point. -->

### The Monster
The Monster scores seven points if they devour any characters.
