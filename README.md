# Castle of Magic: The Card Game
A modern reimagining of a classic board game of magic and intrigue.

Castle of Magic: The Card Game is a game for 4-6 players and can be played in 30-60 minutes.
It is intended for players who are at least twelve years old.

## Background
Thirty years ago, a group of adventurers journeyed to Castle Bondi to confront a Monster that lurked within.
By manipulating the occult power of three arcana they were able to perform a ritual spell and imprison the Monster.
The adventurers later established a network of twenty-seven shrines to channel the magical energies required to ensure that the Monster could not escape its prison.

Recently, three rival factions of wizards have discovered how to corrupt the shrines and use their power to control the countries in which they are located.
As a result, the spell that binds the Monster has begun to falter.

Now, wizards from the three factions have come together to harness the power of the shrines and try to banish the monster once and for all.
If they succeed, their factions will vie for control of the kingdom.
If they fail, they risk releasing the Monster and being devoured as it rampages.

<!-- ## Overview
You will assume the role of a character who has a set of secret objectives.
You will want to try to figure out what the other characters' objectives are and adjust your strategy accordingly.
Some characters have objectives that are mutually compatible.
Those characters are natural allies.
Other characters are natural rivals.

To accomplish your objectives, you will manipulate the cards in a tableau.
Each card can be turned either face up or face down.
Whether you accomplish each of your objectives depends on the state of the tableau at the end of the game.
On your turn you can flip up to two cards, thereby changing the current state of the tableau.

You will use a second set of cards to track your progress.
These cards start face down.
On your turn you can choose to turn one of these cards face up instead of manipulating the tableau.
The game ends when all of these cards have been turned face up.

You will score points for each objective that you accomplish.
You win if you score the most points.

## Characters
There are two kinds of characters, wizards and the Monster.

### Wizards
Each wizard belongs to one of the three factions and is from one of the three countries. Each wizard's affiliations are represented in the form of a coat of arms.

The shield in a character's coat of arms indicates the country that they are from.
The supporters (animals either behind or to either side of the shield) in a character's coat of arms indicate the faction that they belong to.

Each wizard has a set of objectives that is derived from their affiliations.

  - Three objectives are about which faction controls each of the three countries.
     - Ensure that your faction controls Kida.
     - Ensure that your faction controls Marus.
     - Ensure that your faction controls Sorrell.

  - One objective is about which faction controls the wizard's home country.
     - Ensure that your faction controls the country that you are from.

  - Three objectives are about which wizard claims each of the regalia. Wizards who have been devoured by the Monster cannot claim any of the regalia.
     - Claim the amulet.
     - Claim the crown.
     - Claim the scepter.

  - One objective is about what happens to the Monster when the ritual spell is cast.
     - Dominate the Monster.

At most, a wizard can score 7000 points, 1000 points for accomplishing each of seven different objectives.  To do so, their faction must rule all three countries (3000 points) which necessarily ensures that their faction controls the country that they are from (1000 points), they must claim two regalia (2000 points), and they must dominate the Monster as a result of the ritual spell (1000 points).

<!-- ### Cultists
Each basic character belongs to one of the three clans. Cultists do not owe fealty to any of the three countries. Instead, cultists worship the Hydra.

Each cultist scores one point for each country that their guild controls at the end of the game.

Each cultist scores one point for each piece of regalia that they control at the end of the game.

Each cultist scores one point if the Monster devours any characters at the end of the game.

If a cultist is devoured by the Monster, they score one point. -->

### The Monster
The Monster has the ability to disguise itself as a wizard.
If you are the Monster, then you can manipulate the shrines and the ritual cards as if you were a wizard.
The only practical difference between the Monster and a wizard that they have different objectives.

The Monster's only objective is to devour at least one wizard.
If the Monster accomplishes this objective then they score 7000 points.

The Monster can claim regalia but will not score points for doing so.
The Monster cannot devour itself.
