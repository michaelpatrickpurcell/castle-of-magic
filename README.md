## Scoring
There are three kinds of characters: basic characters, cultists, and the hydra.
Each kind of character scores points in different ways.

### Basic Characters
Each basic character belongs to one of the three clans and hails from one of the three countries. Each character's affiliations are represented on their character card in the form of a coat of arms.

The escutcheon (shield) in a character's coat of arms indicates the country to which they owe fealty. The supporters (animals either behind or to either side of the escutcheon) in a character's coat of arms indicate the guild to which they belong.

Each basic character scores one point for each country that their guild controls at the end of the game. They score one additional point if their guild controls the country to which the owe fealty.

Each basic character scores one point for each piece of regalia that they control at the end of the game.

If a basic character is devoured by the Hydra, they score zero points.

### Cultists
Each basic character belongs to one of the three clans. Cultists do not owe fealty to any of the three countries. Instead, cultists worship the Hydra.

Each cultist scores one point for each country that their guild controls at the end of the game.

Each cultist scores one point for each piece of regalia that they control at the end of the game.

If a cultist is devoured by the Hydra, they score one point.

### The Hydra
The Hydra scores seven points if they devour a character during the game.

The Hydra cannot devour themself.
